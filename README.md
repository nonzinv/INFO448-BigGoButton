# INFO448-BigGoButton

The entire screen should consist of a single pushbutton, labeled "Push Me!"

The button should also have a green background, red text, the button text should be 40dp in size and italicized

When I push the "Push Me!" button

1st time: the text should change to read "You have pushed me 1 time!"

Each time after that: the counter in the text should increment by 1

... and the text should read "You have pushed me 2 times!" "... 3 times!" and so on

oh, and the background color should change to a random color

and the text color should randomly change, too
